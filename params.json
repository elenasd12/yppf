  "body": "### Our Application\r\nYoung Professional Personal Finance (YPPF) is a web-based personal finance management service, geared towards alleviating the stress around managing and budgeting expenses. As indicated in the name, YPPF is geared towards young professionals and recent college graduates, as they begin to navigate through the labyrinth of the “real-world”. Inspired by the general intimidation around personal finance by this demographic, YPPF aims to simplify the process of budgeting and personal finance management through this easy to use, visual application. Any young professional or budgeter who doesn’t enjoy the monotony of Excel spreadsheets should and would love to use this application. \r\n\r\n### Background\r\nEden Shoshan, Elena Stoeri D'Arrigo, Karishma Reddy Khan and Mojir Samimi were each students in COSI 166b: Capstone Project for Software Entrepreneurs at Brandeis University in the Spring of 2016. Motivated to acquire as much knowledge as possible, this web-based application is a testament to hard work, collaboration, and exploratory software engineering.\r\n\r\n### Tech specs\r\nThis web-based application was developed with Ruby on Rails and involves a number of software engineering principles. The developing team gained a holistic understanding of the relationships between Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord, JavaScript, and CSS. The product employs an API Highcharts, seen through the multiple visual charts, and AJAX, seen through a consistently asynchronous user experience, to maximize the general quality of the site. The product also relies on the comprehensive understanding of a database-backed product, as all features interact with, query from, or add to the Postgres database.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nEden Shoshan (@eshoshan), Elena Stoeri-D'Arrigo (@elenasd12), Karishma Reddy Khan (@kreddykhan), Mojir Samimi (@mojirsamimi)\r\n\r\n",
